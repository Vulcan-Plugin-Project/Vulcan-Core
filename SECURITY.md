# Security

The Vulcan team works hard to ensure that our code is as secure as possible, however sometimes bugs do make there way into production code. We appreciate your efforts to find and responsibly disclose security and general bugs, and make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security bug, please contact us on our [security website][securitysite]. Please make every effort to report the bug in the correct section (Core Modules each have there own section, along with the Core).
