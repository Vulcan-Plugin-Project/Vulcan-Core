Vulcan is an open-source project, which means any one can get involved and help make it better. That may be by getting involved with the Core development, or the development of Core Modules, or by building your own modules for the world to use.

This file will be updated shortly with some more information about how you can get involved, or [visit our developers site][devsite] for more information.
